description: "The volumes attribute define mount host paths or named volumes that are accessible by service containers. You can use volumes to define multiple types of mounts; volume, bind, tmpfs, or npipe.<br><br>\r\nIf the mount is a host path and is only used by a single service, it can be declared as part of the service definition. To reuse a volume across multiple services, a named volume must be declared in the volumes top-level element."
